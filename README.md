# ANuklear_Examples

Sample programs for ANuklear UI library.

*Note*:

1. Currently, to build the lib, you need to comment out the ```private``` keyword from the ```SDL.C_Pointers``` package.
2. This only binds the SDL renderer as this is early stages.

This is what I have for the ```demo``` program so far. You can move the window and min/maximise it, you can press the button which prints a message, but I don't know why it's not showing correctly.
